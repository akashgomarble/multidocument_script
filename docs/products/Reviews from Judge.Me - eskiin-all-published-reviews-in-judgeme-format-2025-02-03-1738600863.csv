Excellent Showerhead,"I’ve been using the eskiin Showerhead for about three weeks, and I immediately fell in love with the showerhead itself. The stream is better than any showerhead I’ve ever had.

My hair instantly felt better!,"I life in an area that has extremely hard water. I also live in an apartment, so a water softener wasn’t an options for months and months my hair has been extremely dry, brittle, snarly… you name it. NOTHING had been working. I spent so much money on expensive salon hair products… serums, deep conditions, leave in conditioners, moisturizing shampoos and conditioners. I got my hair trimmed a month ago and got a deep moisture treatment at a salon three weeks ago, and my hair was still hopelessly dry. I even had a $30 Amazon filter in my shower head and that wasn’t cutting it. I did some research and found Eskiin. Not only (after three washes so far) has it made my hair softer, less snarled, and less frayed, but the water pressure is amazing! I posted my thoughts on FB, and it turns out many people are dealing with the same hard water issues. I’m so glad I invested in this.",5,2024-03-04 17:53:50 UTC,email,ok,Krystalle Duffy,krystalleduffy@yahoo.com,8266607788349,eskiin-filtered-showerhead,,,,174.234.128.2,"Minneapolis, Minnesota, United States",review-64fef017-0413-4139-a10d-1a5da887d285
Love it so far,I live in upstate NY and we have really hard water. I did some research and decided on this showerhead.

Worth the investment,I have been using the Eskiin for a month now and it is great. I love how soft my hair feels and my skin. I don't even need to lotion after my shower. I have eczema and dermatitis and this filter has cleared up my dry patches on my arms and does not cause irritation to my body or face.

"So Far, So Good","I can't yet speak to the health benefits of my new showerhead because I haven't used it long enough. I didn't order it expecting miracles. But what I can see is that the eskiin produces a strong, relaxing spray that makes me want to take longer showers. Also, it used to take forever for our bath and shower water to heat up because our master bathroom is across the expanse of our house from the water heater. But, and I don't think this is my imagination, the water seems to heat up faster now. If the eskiin does all that AND eventually keeps my skin from drying out and my hair from thinning out, it'll be worth 100 times what I paid for it.",5,2024-10-13 17:52:52 UTC,email,ok,Chris Dortch,chris@blueribbonyearbook.com,8266607788349,eskiin-filtered-showerhead,,,,104.128.161.82,"Ooltewah, Tennessee, United States",review-4031f7c4-892e-42db-b710-1eae51ffc448

Great Product!,"We live in a small town with horrible water - lots of chlorine and other harsh minerals/chemicals. When we would get out of the shower before having the ESKIIN filter, our bodies would feel like we just stepped out of a pool! My hair was brittle and dry and we just couldn't take it anymore. Now with the filter, we dont have the feeling of dry skin or brittle hair. We know when its time for our replacement because our water pressure decreases due to a full, old filter that is ready for replacement. Only thing I wish is that they made a filter for the tub spout because right now we fill our baby's bath tub with the shower head!

Love it but…,We have purchased two and LOVE the filtered water so much. It really has improved our hair rand skin here in AZ where the water is hard and the air is dry.

Waters Feels nice but inconsistent pressure,The water definitely feels nice but the pressure sort of “pulsates” on mine.  Even after  filter change.

This is worth it!!,"I was very skeptical and unsure about a shower head filter for a while. I saw so much about the Jolie shower head and was so close to buying it before deciding to dig deeper and find out that eskiin is more highly rated. When I tell you my water feels like showing in silk I'm not kidding. I live in Philadelphia and noticed my hair and skin suffering (dry, brittle, hair fall). 1 week into using eskiin and my winter skin has healed up, my HAIR is SO SOFT and feels shiny and silky and aive even noticed less hair fall. This is all with the caveat that I use other products to Nourish my skin and hair, but the products are working more effectively that I don't have so much build up on my skin and hair. I can even go longer between hair washes now!

Feels good,Water feels nice and soft. Difficult to get the water filter out though. Upon arrival Eskin recommends you open the head to verify filter is installed. I couldn’t get it off.

Fine Filter,"We are very happy with our eskiin filtered showerhead.
My wife and I both noticed an increased softness in our hair. Our water is on the hard side where we live. There is a slight decrease in forcefulness which I think is part of the design. We previously had an older Speakman showerhead which could really blast you (Cosmo Kramer recommended 😆)
I say...try it. I think you'll be very satisfied.
