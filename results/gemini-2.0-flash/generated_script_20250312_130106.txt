Okay, here are 10 performance marketing creative briefs for Eskiin, incorporating the details and structure you've requested. I've focused on leveraging the provided documents and naming conventions in Google Drive.

*   **Data Insights Column:**  When applicable, I'll include a *Data Insights* section pulling from the `Reviews from Judge.Me` CSV.
*   **Hook Variations Visuals:** I'll keep the visual descriptions concise but actionable. More specific details (camera angles, text overlays) can be elaborated during the scripting process.
*   **The TikTok Hooks Mastery.pdf file has many useful hooks. This document has been greatly used.**
