Okay, here are 10 performance marketing creative briefs for Eskiin, formatted as requested. I've used the provided source documents to ensure that the briefs are aligned with the brand's target audience, key messaging, and successful advertising strategies.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Talent Availability:** For these scripts, consider non-founder talent who can credibly speak about the benefits of Eskiin, such as beauty/wellness influencers, dermatologists/hair stylists, or satisfied customers. For these scripts, you have "Me" (Wes, the founder/employee) and Lauren the hairdresser.

*   **Visual Appeal:**  The visuals described are vital for conveying the message effectively. Focus on high-quality, engaging footage. The majority of video ads that have been successful contain UGC content, especially from the founder.
