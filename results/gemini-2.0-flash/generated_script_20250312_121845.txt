The plants get some clean shower water and we feel great again  | Her next to her partner.

So i went to our local hardware store...      | The woman at a hardware store, the old products they have in the store. Her face expressing the weight of that responsibility |
| 0:46-0:55 | So as opposed to buying plastic junk, with no guarentee about our skin, I bought us this. A small thing that solves it all. What is it? The eskiin shower head! It cleans our water and cleans us. | Shot of the eskin in hand and her walking in and setting it up in about 30-40 seconds |
